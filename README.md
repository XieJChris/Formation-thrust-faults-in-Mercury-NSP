# A mechanical model of thrust-faults related landforms: Application to Mercury's Northern Smooth Plains
* Supplementary for *A mechanical model of thrust-faults related landforms: Application to Mercury's Northern Smooth Plains*.  
  
* This repository only contains the necessary codes for this 2-D convectional simulation. 

* There are three folders, the folder named Plugin contains the source code of multi-compositional radioactive heating, the folder named Data contains the initial temperature profile, and the folder named prm contains the parameter file.

* The source codes of the plugins are written on the basis of the codes provided by the fully-open finite element code: Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion, ASPECT. And tested with the ASPECT-2.3.0.

* As for the rest of source codes running the simulation, they can be accessed through: https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect
  
* This model can run on Linux platforms, for example, CentOS/Ubuntu LTS. Before running, refer to the relevant manual (https://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf) to download, install and configure the necessary running environment.
