# Dating the contraction of Mercury: From the perspective of mantle convection
* Supplementary for *Dating the contraction of Mercury: From the perspective of mantle convection*.  
  
* This repository only contains the necessary codes for this 2-D convectional simulation. 

* There are three folders, the folder named source contains the source code, the folder named Data contains the initial temperature profile, and the folder named prm contains the parameter file.

* The source codes are written on the basis of the codes provided by the fully-open finite element code: Advanced Solver for Problems in Earth's ConvecTion, ASPECT. And teseted with the ASPECT-2.3.0. For details about ASPECT, refer to: https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect
  
* This model can run on Linux platforms, for example, CentOS/Ubuntu LTS. Before running, refer to the relevant manual (https://www.math.clemson.edu/~heister/manual.pdf) to download, install and configure the necessary running environment.
